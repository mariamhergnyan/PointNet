# 3D Object Classification with PointNet

The original paper used for inspiration is from the following link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593
The data can be downloaded from the following link: https://modelnet.cs.princeton.edu/

The architecture of PointNet is different for ModelNet10 and ModelNet40, therefore the files that relate to them have the indication as a number in the end. 
For example: run the `train_pointnet_10.py` or `train_pointnet_40.py`script in order to lanch training.
